# Elixir2024

To run code for one day, run `Ã¬ex -S mix` in the terminal. 
In the interactive shell you can then call functions, like `Day1.part1` to run them.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `elixir2024` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:elixir2024, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```
