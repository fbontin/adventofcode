# adventofcode2021

Solutions to Advent of Code for 2021, written in Elixir.

## To start

`iex -S mix`

Then to run just call the function, e.g. for day2:
`Day2.part1`

## Day 1

Solution for day 1 is made using [Livebook](https://livebook.dev/). I encountered some problems with livebook later so chose "regular" Elixir for the other days.

To start Livebook, run this in the terminal:
`livebook server`
